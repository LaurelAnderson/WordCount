Boba Fett was the unaltered clone of Jango Fett, a human male Mandalorian bounty hunter who raised Boba as his son during the Republic Era. Fett emulated his genetic donor, whom he regarded as his father, by wearing a customized suit of Mandalorian armor. His personal starship was the Slave I, a Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft that once belonged to Jango. Trained in combat and martial skills from a young age, Fett was one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy during the Imperial Era. He became a legend over the course of his career, which included contracts for both the Galactic Empire and the extensive criminal underworld.
