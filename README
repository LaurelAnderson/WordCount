Write a program (in C) targeted at the Linux platform which reads words from one or more les, and prints out a list
of the most frequently occurring sequential pairs of words and the number of times they occurred, in decreasing order of
occurrence.

Example: If a le contained the text \This is a nasty assignment and it will take me two weeks to do this nasty assign-
ment. I should probably start on it early. I suspect it will take 300-500 lines of code.", the word pairs \nasty assignment",
\it will" and \will take" would each be detected as having 2 occurrences, while all the other sequential pairs have only
one occurrence
